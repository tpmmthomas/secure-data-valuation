# Multi point protocol

## Semi-honest scenario

In the semi-honest scenario, M, y protected. Only portion of x sent to Alice.

1. Bob does clustering.
2. Bob queries point with Alice using MPC. (Point weighting, calculate thing like entropy)
3. Alice receives those few points and does everything for uncertainty and diversity, MPC of y and y' to calculate loss.

## Malicious scenario

1. Bob does clustering. (No protection, as supposedly dont have interest)
2. MPC for weighting (suppose use cloud structure? any more ways)
3. ALl diversity + loss and uncertinaty computation by ZKP? (or MPC that protects. Check Overeleaf)
